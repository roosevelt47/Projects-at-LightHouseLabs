# Short Project descriptions

## The Stolen Szechuan Sauce
This project uses a scenario created by DFIR Madness. You will work through Case 001, The Stolen Szechuan Sauce. https://dfirmadness.com/the-stolen-szechuan-sauce/
  
## Logs, IoCs, Thresholds, and Alerts case study report
Create a report that gives recommendations on sensors that should be monitored, associating the sensor with well known IoCs for the organization in the case study. The report explains what sensors should be used, prioritizing them and connecting them to IoCs, threats and vulnerabilities. It specifies what alert thresholds need to be set and why.

## Log Monitoring Workflow Project
You work as an Access Log Analyst at Turn a New Leaf. Your manager has asked you to monitor the logs for any unusual network traffic, and send them an alert if there is an unusual number of failed logins. They’ve asked you to ensure there is documentation of this, and to provide a weekly update by email.

You want to create a workflow for this process, using programming to make it as efficient and low-maintenance as possible

## Cat's Company Vulnerabilities
Cat needs your help providing critical information to the executive team to help them make decisions and preparations that uphold the security of the organization.

Now that you have completed the vulnerability assessment scan Cat has asked you to do, she has asked you to collect all the information to prioritize the vulnerabilities that were found from highest risk to lowest, and determine what information would be necessary for the executive team to make decisions and preparations to have them mitigated.

Cat wants to make sure the executive team has all the information they need, but she knows that they don’t have a lot of time. She has asked you to write a vulnerability assessment report on your findings that explains the issues you found, what is affected, what it might mean to the business, and what suggestions you recommend to fix the issues.

## Encryption
The company hired you as a Junior Cyber Security analyst. After a few years of experience and different certifications, you became the Senior Cyber Security analyst and moved to an SOC, where you became the supervisor
After a few months, you're the Cyber Security manager with time, dedication, and expertise.

As a new Cyber Security manager, you must define the encryption level and the best use of resources to protect employees and company information. You focus on becoming the company's chief information security officer (CISO). You must understand some everyday problems.

You not only have to review the entire Cyber Security policy for the company, but also start the conversation to utilize basic concepts to protect the users.

To present to the company's board, write a report and be prepared to explain it to the board and to all the tech teams working with you.

The report must be written using an executive format such that it can be understood by readers with techincal as well as non-technical background.

## Investigation & Research Report On Marriott Data Breach 2018

Write a research report on the attack you researched and documented your findings about.

## Capstone Project
The project involves responding to a security incident at Premium House Lights triggered by a suspicious extortion email. The company is uncertain about the claims and the extent of a potential compromise. As part of the incident response team, the task is to investigate and create a report. Artifacts provided for analysis include a Network Diagram, Wireshark Captures, Access Logs, Session Logs, Database Logs, and Database data. The goal is to assess the threat and formulate an incident response plan based on the artifacts. Final Project during the Cybersecurity Bootcamp at LightHouseLabs.
